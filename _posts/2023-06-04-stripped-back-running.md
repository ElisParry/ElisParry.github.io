I've been wanting to start a blog to share some of my thoughts for a while, so here is my first post! These are a few words about **stripping back** to the basics of running.

I, like many, vividly remember my first experience of the so-called 'runners high' and, to this day, this is the feeling I keep on seeking from running. When I first started running, I had no fancy kit, no extra add-ons, and no form of recording my runs - it was just me and my surroundings. Every run felt like an adventure, providing enjoyment, and a sense of fulfillment. This continued for a while, however, as I became more and more 'obsessed' with running, things started **changing**. I was getting fitter and stronger, able to run further, faster, and for longer. As a result, I started accumulating a substantial collection of running-related apparel to, presumably, improve my training and racing. However, over time, running became less and less enjoyable, and sometimes even bordered on feeling like a chore. 

When I first started running, I felt an unrivaled sense of freedom, but this started dwindling over time. As this was happening, and I seemed to be falling more and more out of love with running, I reflected on when I started running; trying to figure out what had changed and why I felt different. It immediately clicked - it happened as a result of always wanting more. 

Don't get me wrong, I think that training purely for speed or endurance has its place, however, I am starting to realise that this can be done without meticulously analysing every kilometer that you run. At the time, I cared far too much about stats on Strava, and my typical 'run routine' looked something like this:

* **Pre-run**: Finding an 'efficient' route that didn't have many road crossings or much danger of getting lost, picking a song to listen to with my hi-tech running headphones, uploading the route to my watch, deciding which pace I would run at, roll my legs with an unnecessarily expensive foam roller before finally leaving the house. 

* **During the run**: Tune out and listen to music whilst constantly keeping an eye on my pace (pausing whenever I stopped) and heart rate - getting frustrated whenever they deviated from my planned 'zones' - and not taking in my beautiful surroundings whilst thinking of what I could caption my Strava run as to get as many kudos as possible.

* **Post run**: Uploading my run to Strava as soon as I got home - disappointed if I hadn't stuck to the plan or if the so-called 'coach' on my watch or Strava said that I was  'under-training', or 'losing fitness' - and then comparing myself to over 300 other runners. 

You get the gist... this was roughly what my 'run' routine looked like, and I'm sure many of you can relate to this. So what's the problem? 

## 1. Constant comparison

I reached the point where no matter how good I felt during my run, the constant comparison with other athletes resulted in me always wanting more and never being satisfied or happy with my accomplishments. Although I think tracking apps like Strava have their benefits, I believe that for many, like myself, these apps take away from the true enjoyment of running and can result in an endless cycle of dissatisfaction. 


*Solution: Either go completely 'cold-turkey' with your running watch and Strava or, if you still like tracking your runs, avoid aimlessly scrolling through Strava after every run.*

## 2. Always wanting more

Most might not see a problem with having more running gadgets and kit, however, I started caring too much about what my kit looked like and how much it cost. No matter what you think, at the end of the day, the vast majority of running apparel companies simply want to make a profit and, as a result, they will do absolutely everything they can to convince you that their new hi-tech product is necessary - often claiming to improve your speed, performance, recovery, etc. I fell for this trap, but soon noticed that my loss of love for running coincided with this accumulation and over-consumption of new kit. There is no need for a different shoe for every type of 'session' under the sun, the newest GPS watch along with all of its add-ons, or even running-specific clothes. Yes, they might make things more convenient, but in my opinion, they draw away from the simplistic nature of running and result in us, as consumers, always wanting more. 

*Solution: Use the things you already have and ignore these money-making schemes that claim to improve your running. If a piece of kit is necessary, aim to buy second-hand or borrow from a friend. Instead of splurging money on unnecessary kit, invest your time and money into improving your performance through things such as strength training, mobility, and better eating.*

## 3. Being blind to our surroundings

For me, this was the biggest problem. Constantly looking at your watch and/or listening to music during a run, in my opinion, results in us being as disconnected as ever to nature when running. Many ask: how do you not get bored? My answer: listen, look, and feel your surroundings. From birds singing to wind and rain blowing into your face - by stripping back and connecting to nature, I feel like I've re-found the same, if not more excitement in running as when I first started. 

*Solution: Go on some runs with nothing but you, your shoes, and your clothes and you will realise just how many interesting things are going on around you.*

These are just a few of the things that I noticed that affected my own running, and by addressing these points, I think that everyone's running can benefit in one way another. Ultimately, I believe that we feel the greatest satisfaction from our running the more we **strip back** to our roots and immerse ourselves in nature. Forget about the pace, the distance, and the aesthetics and just go out and explore some new trails and streets! Having done this myself for the first half of this year, it has naturally lead me to being in the best shape I've ever been in both physically and mentally, and I look forward to continue to strip back in the future.

That's it for my first blog post, I hope you found it interesting! There will be further discussion of some of the topics mentioned here in future posts :)
