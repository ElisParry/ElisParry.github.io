This is a post about why I run. 


I run to feel free. 

I run to explore.

I run to be in nature.

I run to climb mountains.

I run to get stronger.

I run to be healthy.

I run to be with friends.

I run to move my body.

I run to clear my mind.

I run to inspire.

I run to feel connected with the earth. 

I run because its simple.

I run because of the amazing community.

I run because it provides a constant positive in my life.

I run because the suffering makes me grow.

I run because I want to find and push my limits. 

I run because I love adventure. 

I run for those peaceful moments. 

I run for beautiful sunrises and sunsets. 

I run for solitude.

I run for happiness.

I run because I can run. 


I run for me. 


These are some of the reasons why I run, now. I will continue to reflect on my 'why' as I grow older. These reasons will change over time, but I believe that having a 'why', be it big or small, can make all the difference, in all aspects of your life. When I don't want to run, I remember the 'why'. Ultimately, I run for me. If I don't work on myself, I won't be able to help others.
