I first started to run during the COVID pandemic. For the first time in my life, I struggled with my mental health. For a while, I internalised how I felt and started to feel stuck and isolated. One day, I decided to set out for a run to try to clear my head. It was only then that I realised the power of running.  

Since 2020, running has been a big, important part of my life. From the start, I'd always liked to set myself challenges in my running. After a year of running, I signed up to my first ever running race - a 100 km ultramarathon to raise money for charity. I DNFd on the day, dropping out at the 80 km mark. But the journey taught me something important - there's no shame in a DNF. Why? It's about the process, not the outcome.  

Over the next couple of years at university, my passion for running became greater. I set up an ultrarunning club and tried to encourage friends and family to start running. I knew how much it had helped me, so I wanted others to be able to share the same experience. During this time, the purpose of my running became greater - to try to help promote a greener, more sustainable way of running and to encourage others to respect nature. Being a member of the Green Runners and Re-Action Collective's first (un)sponsored athlete has offered the space and community to help do this. However, my running has shifted back to playing an important part for my **mind** over the past few months.  

I've been struggling again with my mental health, but luckily, I've still been able to lace up my shoes and use running and nature as a medicine. But, unfortunately, not all of us have experienced nor understand the power of being in nature or exercising outdoors. This is why, on the 29th of August 2025, I will be racing the Ring o' Fire, attempting to run around the Isle of Anglesey (Ynys Mon) in one go to raise money for Mind Over Mountains.  

Mind Over Mountains is a charity offering mental wellbeing support for people who are struggling by offering opportunities to go hiking in nature with others. Their work is touching as it challenges the stigma surrounding mental health and integrates the powerful ability of the outdoors with more traditional mindfulness practices. This gives people the *chance* to feel free again; to gain some clarity in the mountains.  

This challenge will be my biggest challenge yet. By a long shot. 215 km around the Anglesey coastal path. I've named it the Ring of Hope. I will give it my all and I'm sure that I will finish knowing that there are people all around the world having to fight far tougher battles, every day.  

Anglesey coastal path. August 2025. Raising money for Mind Over Mountains. Let's rock and roll.
