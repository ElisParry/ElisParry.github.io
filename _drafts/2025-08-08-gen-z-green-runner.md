Do you see what I did there? Apparently Gen Zs are also known as zoomers; hence the play on words in the title. Maybe it's not as funny as I thought...

Since joining the Green Runners, I've been a big fan of the sense of community, albeit mostly online, in the group. People are always receptive to new ideas and are happy to discuss all things related to greener running. However, one thing that I did notice was that I might be on the younger side in terms of age compared to most of the other members. But this is exciting, as I view it as an opportunity to try to levarge this to help grow the amount of Green Runner Gen Zs. In fact, it was when volunteering at the Love Trails festival that I realised that the way I spoke out about TGR was different when speaking to the younger generation. I noticed that my pitch changed a little to try to make it more relatable to people around my age. You see, it's tricky to convince someone to run around in patched up clothes and shoes if this is not the cool, fashionable thing to do. But if you flip the nail on it's head and tell a skint student that it will save them money *and* help the planet, then they start to become more interested. So, this is a post about being a Gen Z Green Runner. Also, is it just me that finds the letter Z strange?

# Setting new trends? 

Growing up as a Gen Z, there were always various trends floating around - fashion trends, exercise trends, cooking trends etc. - and I've always been wary of trends as they're exactly what they say on the tin. Trends come and go - one day something is considered 'trendy', the next it has gone out of trend and is just seen as being strange. This is one of the main issues with the fashion industry and the foundation of fast fashion - things are marketed as trendy, only for them to slowly go out of trend; making the 'consumer' think that they need to switch up their style to keep looking cool. OK, so for fast fashion, we can probably all agree that trends aren't necessarily a good thing for the planet or, in fact, our pockets. But what about other trends? Trends that *aren't* so bad. Just like most things, I think there is opportunity to leverage some trends to our advantage as Green Runners. The challenge lies in overcoming the hurdle of convincing the younger generation that it isn't uncool to advocate for change and to speak up about climate change. 

Personally, I have some hope as I think that the younger generation are now acutely aware about climate change and the effects that it is and *could* have on them. At least I think we're more aware than the older generation, simply because it's becoming more and more real. This means that a lot of younger people also want to try to drive for change and to do things that will help tackle climate change and make the world a better place. The difficult part is taking that step to speak up. I'm still not sure that it is cool or trendy to speak out about climate change, but I think the bigger issue lies in lack of confidence or fear of being challenged. Like in many cases, the societal hierarchy often means that younger children and/or adults don't feel confident to speak out about issues in case someone older will shut them down. But, thankfully, I think times are changing and believe that we, as Gen Zs, are in a great position to step up. I think that it *is* trendy to advocate for change - especially when it's a win win for everyone involved. 

So, ultimately, I think it's about jumping on the bandwagon with the trends that could help us in our mission and to inform others about the damage that other trends are doing. Let's make it trendy to save the planet :) Oh, and what about wearing patched up kit? Lets start to make this a cool through leading by example. It's not about how stylish the kit that we're wearing is, it's about the simple act of running, outside, in nature. 

# Honouring the responsibility

The next thing I'd like to touch on is the sense of responsibility that I feel. I'd like to think that this feeling is also shared by many others around my age too. 

It's sometimes talked about that climate change is the result of the industrial revolution and the lifestyles and actions of the generation above mine and that, therefore, it is their responsibility to clean up the mess that they have created. I see this side of the argument but, unfortunately, unless we realise that we have a *collective* responsibility to protect our planet, then I don't think we'll make much progress. Personally, I realised that *inaction* was no longer a viable option. It's easy to play the card of ignorance is bliss, but as soon as I opened my eyes to what's *really* happening, I felt a desire to start doing something about it. I felt a sense of responsibility. To protect the places that I love to run in and to drive for change. 

Nowdays, we like to have goals to pursue - especially the younger generation, who have grown up in what could be called an time of hussle culture. So, for me, when I realised that I could channel some of my time and energy to speak out, joining groups like The Green Runners, it was a no brainer. It's killed two bird with one stone - I feel as if I am working towards a goal, a shared one, and also helping the world at the same time. The truth is, unless we honour the responsibility to start changing the tides (ironic!), then who's going to do so?
